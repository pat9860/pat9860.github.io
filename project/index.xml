      <description>0. Introduction (4 pts) I have chosen two datasets that deal with different types of crime across the United States in 2 different time periods. One dataset (USArrests) looks at arrest statistics for violent crimes across all 50 states in 1973 under the variables &amp;quot;Murder&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Assault&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Rape&amp;quot;, along with the &amp;quot;UrbanPop&amp;quot; statistic that calculates the percent of the population of said state being primarily urban. State name was given as a label for the Y axis and not as its own categorical variable, so I made name of state its own variable (&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;).</description>

While not the biggest fan of trading sports cards myself, I definitely come from a family of people that were avid collectors of baseball, football, and basketball cards. The money and fanatacism behind these cards is incredible and can be very lucrative for some owners.</description>
