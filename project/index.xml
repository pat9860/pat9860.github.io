      <description>0. Introduction (4 pts) I have chosen two datasets that deal with different types of crime across the United States in 2 different time periods. One dataset (USArrests) looks at arrest statistics for violent crimes across all 50 states in 1973 under the variables &amp;quot;Murder&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Assault&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Rape&amp;quot;, along with the &amp;quot;UrbanPop&amp;quot; statistic that calculates the percent of the population of said state being primarily urban. State name was given as a label for the Y axis and not as its own categorical variable, so I made name of state its own variable (&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;).</description>

      <description>0. (5 pts) Introduction
While not the biggest fan of trading sports cards myself, I definitely come from a family of people that were avid collectors of baseball, football, and basketball cards. The money and fanatacism behind these cards is incredible and can be very lucrative for some owners. This dataset decided to measure if the value of these collectible cards increased due to ownership. This was done by randomly selecting 148 total traders at a trading card show.</description>
